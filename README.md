Free Code Camp - Wikipedia Viewer
=====================

This is my solution to the [FCC - Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer).
The live demo can be seen here: [CodePen](http://s.codepen.io/Neoplatonist/debug/RRoMey).

### Requirements
* Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.
* Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
* Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
* User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
* User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
